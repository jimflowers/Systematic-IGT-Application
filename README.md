# A New Project Template

> Structure of the Repository: it’s Important.

Here is one way to organize your project folders:

	/code
	/data
	/docs
	/output
	README.md
	
# Get started

Just copy-paste the following command into your command-line:

`mkdir -p code data docs output`

Or, create the folders manually with macOS Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.

# More directories

If you want more directories, see the `advanced` branch.

# Inspirations/Resources/References

The original insipration of this structure is for data science'y projects using
mostly R and/or Python.
